      <h5>Personal</h5>
      <p>Last year a litter of kittens were born in my back yard that all struggled with health
          and needed to be rescued. After five weeks of antibiotics and several vet trips, they seemed
          to be doing okay! Due to the constant care of these kittens, I got so attached that I kept 
          three of them and the mom. This is the story how I went from a dog person, to an owner of three
          cats.

      <h5>Work</h5>
      <p>After graduating from Ohio State in 2016 I've moved around a lot. I started my first engineering job
          in 2017 as a Laser Welding Engineer / Supplier Quality Engineer in Cleveland, OH. This provided great experience and a 
          meaniful work environment. Though I enjoyed this job, for career growth, I took a job at Honda in Indiana. Here I was 
          one of two Weldability Engineers responsable for the 250 resistance welding robots in the welding department. 
          This was another satifying job, but in 2020 I moved back to Ohio for family reasons. I'm not living in Columbus, OH, and 
          drive to Troy for work daily as an Arc Welding Engineer. This is another great opportunity that I am greatful for. Here I 
          got to spend more time programming robots, which solidified my interest in Computer Programming!
